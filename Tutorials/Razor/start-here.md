#### ASP stands for Active Server Pages

    It was developed by Microsoft as a server-side scripting technology for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. ASP allows you to embed server-side code (typically written in VBScript or JScript) into HTML pages, which is executed on the server before the page is sent to the client's browser.

### First Command

dotnet new webapp -o RazorPagesMovie
The dotnet new command creates a new Razor Pages project in the RazorPagesMovie folder.
